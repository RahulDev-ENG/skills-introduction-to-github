<h3>USER INTERFACE</h3>
<hr>


    
<p class="topic">From wikipedia,the free encyclopedia</p>

<p class="line">In the industrial design field of human-computer interaction,a<span class="red-text"> user interface (UI) </span> is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction
    is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making 
    Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls process controls.           
    The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to,or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology.Generally, the goal of  user interface
    is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly)  to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability).
    This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.
    
<p class="line"> User interfaces are composed of one or more layers, including a human-machine interface (HMI) that typically interfaces machines with physical input hardware (such as keyboards, 
    mice, or game pads) and output hardware (such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers). A device that implements an HMI is called a human interface device (HID). User interfaces
    that dispense with the physical movement of body parts as an intermediary step between the brain and the machine use no input or output devices except electrodes alone; they are called 
    brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or brain-machine interfaces (BMIs).Other terms for human-machine interfaces are man-machine interface (MMI) and, when the machine in question is a computer,
    human-computer interface. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human senses,<b> including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), 
    equilibria UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).</b></p>
    
<p class="line">Composite user interfaces (CUIs) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a <span class="blue-text">graphical user interface (GUI)</span> , which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual 
    UI capable of displaying graphics. When sound is added to a GUI, it becomes a multimedia user interface (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: standard, virtual and augmented.
    Standard CUI use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a virtual reality, the CUI is virtual and
    uses a virtual reality interface. When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates augmented reality, the CUI is augmented and uses an augmented reality interface. When a UI 
    interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of qualia.[citation needed] CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as 
    either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a Smell-O-Vision is a 3-sense (3S) 
    Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when virtual reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when 
    augmented reality interfaces interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.</p>

<p class="line">The user interface or human-machine interface is the part of the machine that handles 
    the human-machine interaction. Membrane switches, rubber keypads and touchscreens  are examples of
    the physical part of the Human Machine Interface which we can see and touch.</p>

<p class="line">In complex systems, the humanâ€“machine interface is typically computerized. The term 
    human-computer interface refers to this kind of system. In the context of computing, the
    term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for
    human-computer interaction.</p>
